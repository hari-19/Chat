# Chat

A chat app using Django Channels and Angular Frontend

### After a Major update to django channels, the Backend was updated. The updated Backend is at Backend2 folder.

### This project's aim was to understand the working of django channels. Since, I got the understanding of it using the simple HTML form chat module (For Testing Purposes) inside Django Application, the development of the Angular Frontend is abandoned as of now. Its mainly because there are already a ton of Chat applications in the market and there is no need for yet another service.
